# Awesome - Natural Language Processing in Support of Evidence-based Medicine

# Acknowledgement
This project was sponsored by the National Library of Medicine grant R01LM009886, R01LM014344, and R01LM014573.

A curated list of Natural Language Processing (NLP) research papers in the field of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM).  

This list is based on the scoping review **‚ÄúNatural Language Processing in Support of Evidence-Based Medicine: A Scoping Review‚Äù** (ACL 2025 submission), which surveyed **129 peer-reviewed publications** from 2019‚Äì2024.

The growth of medical literature demands automated tools to support clinicians in searching, appraising, synthesizing, and applying evidence in clinical practice. NLP is at the core of this transformation.


## NLP techniques for EBM

### 1. **Ask** ‚Äì Search and Question Formulation

### 2. **Acquire** ‚Äì Extracting Evidence
- Entity Extraction and Normalization
- Relation Extraction

### 3. **Appraise, Synthesize, and Summarization**
- Quality Assessment
- Evidence Ranking and Screening
- Evidence Synthesis
- Evidence Summarization

### 4. **Apply & Assess** ‚Äì Adoption, refinement and research
- Specialty-Specific adoption
- Clinical Trial design and identification
- Drug Repurposing
- Question Answering

Automating or semi-automating the data extraction of index test, target condition, and reference standard from articles has the potential to decrease the cost of conducting systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy, but relevant training data is not available. We create a distantly supervised dataset of approximately 90,000 sentences, and let two experts manually annotate a small subset of around 1,000 sentences for evaluation. We evaluate the performance of BioBERT and logistic regression for ranking the sentences, and compare the performance for distant and direct supervision. Our results suggest that distant supervision can work as well as, or better than direct supervision on this problem, and that distantly trained models can perform as well as, or better than human annotators.",

The corpus will be helpful for the development of systems for automatic extraction of data from randomized controlled trial literature to support evidence-based medicine. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the corpus by using two strong baselines for named entity recognition task. Most of the entities achieve F1 scores greater than 0.80 demonstrating the quality of the dataset.",

    abstract = "Ellipsis is a linguistic phenomenon characterized by the omission of one or more sentence elements. Solving such a linguistic construction is not a trivial issue in natural language processing since it involves the retrieval of non-overtly expressed verbal material, which might in turn require the model to integrate human-like syntactic and semantic knowledge. In this paper, we explored the issue of how the prototypicality of event participants affects the ability of Language Models (LMs) to handle elliptical sentences and to identify the omitted arguments at different degrees of thematic fit, ranging from highly typical participants to semantically anomalous ones. With this purpose in mind, we built ELLie, the first dataset composed entirely of utterances containing different types of elliptical constructions, and structurally suited for evaluating the effect of argument thematic fit in solving ellipsis and reconstructing the missing element. Our tests demonstrated that the probability scores assigned by the models are higher for typical events than for atypical and impossible ones in different elliptical contexts, confirming the influence of prototypicality of the event participants in interpreting such linguistic structures. Finally, we conducted a retrieval task of the elided verb in the sentence in which the low performance of LMs highlighted a considerable difficulty in reconstructing the correct event.",

For medical applications, unfortunately, all language communities other than English are low-resourced. In this work, we present GGPONC (German Guideline Program in Oncology NLP Corpus), a freely dis tributable German language corpus based on clinical practice guidelines for oncology. This corpus is one of the largest ever built from German medical documents. Unlike clinical documents, clinical guidelines do not contain any patient-related information and can therefore be used without data protection restrictions. Moreover, GGPONC is the first corpus for the German language covering diverse conditions in a large medical subfield and provides a variety of metadata, such as literature references and evidence levels. By applying and evaluating existing medical information extraction pipelines for German text, we are able to draw comparisons for the use of medical language to other corpora, medical and non-medical ones.",

abstract = {We present a search engine aimed to help clinicians find targeted treatments for children with cancer. Childhood cancer is a leading cause of death and clinicians increasingly seek treatments that are tailored to an individual patient, particularly their tumour genetics. Finding treatments that are specific to paediatrics and match individual genetics is a real challenge amongst the vast and growing body of medical literature and clinical trials. We aim to help clinicians through a search system tailored to this problem.The system retrieves PubMed articles and clinical trials. Entity extraction is done to highlight genes, drugs and cancers --- three key information types clinicians care about. Query suggestion helps clinicians formulate otherwise difficult queries and results are presented as a knowledge graph to help result interpretability. The proposed system aims to both significantly reduce the effort of searching for targeted treatments and potentially find life saving treatments that may have otherwise been missed.
